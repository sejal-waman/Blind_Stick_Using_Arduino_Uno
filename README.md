### Smart Blind Stick - An IoT Project for Visually Impaired Users ###

The Smart Blind Stick is an assistive device designed to empower visually impaired individuals by enhancing their ability to navigate their surroundings safely and independently. This project leverages Arduino and IoT technology to provide real-time obstacle detection and user assistance. The device is compact, cost-effective, and easy to use, aiming to make a positive impact on the lives of its users.

### Features:

## Obstacle Detection-

Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the userâ€™s path.

Alerts the user through vibration and sound feedback when an obstacle is detected within a predefined range.


## Real-Time Data Processing-

Implements efficient algorithms in C language to process sensor data instantly.

Ensures timely feedback to the user for a seamless navigation experience.


## User-Friendly Interface-

Provides an intuitive interface for configuring sensitivity settings, alert modes, and other parameters.

Configuration can be done through simple button-based inputs.


## Portable and Lightweight Design-

Designed for daily use with an ergonomic structure.

Lightweight to ensure user comfort over extended periods.





### Components:###

## Hardware-

1. Arduino Uno

Microcontroller for processing sensor data and controlling the output devices.



2. Ultrasonic Sensors

Detect obstacles by measuring distance through sound waves.



3. Vibration Motor

Provides haptic feedback for obstacle alerts.



4. Buzzer

Generates sound alerts for immediate attention.



5. Power Supply

Battery-operated for portability.




*Software-*

Programming Language: C

Development Environment: Arduino IDE




## How It Works ##

1. Sensor Detection

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance between the stick and nearby obstacles.



2. Data Processing

The data is processed using custom algorithms written in C.

If the obstacle is within the threshold distance, the system triggers alerts.



3. Feedback Mechanism

The vibration motor and buzzer provide tactile and auditory alerts, helping the user navigate safely.
